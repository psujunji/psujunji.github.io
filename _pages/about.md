[[Google Scholar]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ppUwOsAAAAJ&hl=en) [[Linkedin]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jun-ji-891012198/) 

I received [Ph.D. in Acoustics](https://www.acs.psu.edu/) from Penn State University in Dec 2023, and B.Eng from Jiangsu University in June 2018.

My research during my postdoc focuses on integrated phononic circuits and their classical and quantum applications, under the supervision of Pro.[Linbo Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GvM1YIAAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Hybrid Nanoscale Systems Research Group](https://shaogroup.ece.vt.edu).

My research during my PhD focuses on meta-materials-based acoustic devices at audio and ultrasonic frequency, under the supervision of Prof.[Yun Jing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nkb3d8UAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [SIMBA Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/jinglab/). 


<!-- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
