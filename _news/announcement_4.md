We have developed synthetic domain computing and neural network based on our nonlinear phononic devices at GHz frequencies. Our device-aware neural network can perform a four-class classification task with an accuracy of 98.2%. Our devices feature a wide operation temperature range up to 192 Â°C. This work is published in Nature Electronics.
